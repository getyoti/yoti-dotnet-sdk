Yoti .NET SDK
=============

Welcome to the Yoti .NET SDK. This repo contains the tools and step by step instructions you need to quickly integrate your .NET back-end with Yoti so that your users can share their identity details with your application in a secure and trusted way.

## An Architectural view

To integrate your application with Yoti, your back-end must expose a GET endpoint that Yoti will use to forward tokens.
The endpoint can be configured in Yoti Dashboard when you create/update your application.

The image below shows how your application back-end and Yoti integrate in the context of a Login flow.
Yoti SDK carries out for you steps 6, 7 ,8 and the profile decryption in step 9.

Yoti also allows you to enable user details verification from your mobile app by means of the Android (TBA) and iOS (TBA) SDKs. In that scenario, your Yoti-enabled mobile app is playing both the role of the browser and the Yoti app. By the way, your back-end doesn't need to handle these cases in a significantly different way. You might just decide to handle the `User-Agent` header in order to provide different responses for web and mobile clients.

## Compiling the NuGet package

To compile the NuGet package you will need to install NuGet. You can find instructions to do that [here](http://docs.nuget.org/ndocs/guides/install-nuget)

Next clone this repo and ensure that the Yoti.Auth project has been compiled in Release configuration.

Finally run the following command from the `<repo-path>/src` folder:

```
nuget pack Yoti.Auth.nuspec
```

## Enabling the SDK

To import the Yoti SDK inside your project, you should use the NuGet Yoti.Auth Package

```
Install-Package Yoti.Auth
```

_We are not yet on NuGet, so, for the moment, in order to use the SDK you need to clone this repo and run_ `Install-Package Yoti.Auth -Source "<repo-path>/src"` _from the Package Manager Console._

## Client initialisation

The YotiClient is the SDK entry point. To initialise it you need include the following snippet inside your endpoint initialisation section:

```cs
const string sdkId = "your-sdk-id";
var privateKeyStream = System.IO.File.OpenText("path/to/your-application-pem-file.pem");
var yotiClient = new YotiClient(sdkId, privateKeyStream);
```

Where:

* `sdkId` is the sdk identifier generated by Yoti Dashboard when you create (and then publish) your app. _Note this is not your Application Identifier which is needed by your clientside code_
* `path/to/your-application-pem-file.pem` - When you create your app on Yoti Dashboard, your browser generates a .pem file. This is the path to that file.


## Profile retrieval

When your application receives a token via the exposed endpoint (it will be assigned to a query string parameter named `token`), you can easily retrieve the user profile by adding the following to your endpoint handler:

```cs
var activityDetails = yotiClient.GetActivityDetails(token);
```

Or if you are in an asynchronous method:

```cs
var activityDetails = await yotiClient.GetActivityDetailsAsync(token);
```

Before you inspect the user profile, you might want to check whether the user validation was successful.
This is done as follows:

```cs
var activityDetails = yotiClient.GetActivityDetails(token);
if (activityDetails.Outcome == ActivityOutcome.Success)
{
    var profile = activityDetails.UserProfile;
}
else
{
    // handle unhappy path
}
```

## Handling users

When you retrieve the user profile, you receive a userId generated by Yoti exclusively for your application.
This means that if the same individual logs into another app, Yoti will assign her/him a different id.
You can use such id to verify whether the retrieved profile identifies a new or an existing user.
Here is an example of how this works:

```cs
var activityDetails = yotiClient.GetActivityDetails(token);
if (activityDetails.Outcome == ActivityOutcome.Success)
{
    var profile = activityDetails.UserProfile;
    var user = YourUserSearchFunction(profile.Id);
    if (user != null)
    {
        // handle login
    }
    else
    {
        // handle registration
    }
}
else
{
    // handle unhappy path
}
```
Where `yourUserSearchFunction` is a piece of logic in your app that is supposed to find a user, given a userId.
No matter if the user is a new or an existing one, Yoti will always provide her/his profile, so you don't necessarily need to store it.

The `profile` object provides a set of attributes corresponding to user attributes. Whether the attributes are present or not depends on the settings you have applied to your app on Yoti Dashboard.
